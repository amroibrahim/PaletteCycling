# Palette Cycling Demos
Effects using palette cycling

After watching this [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjQik7uwLIQ) by Retro Game Mechanics Explained I was intrested to try and implement some of those effects.

## Requirements
* Visual Studio 2017  
* SDL 2.0  

## Palette Cycling
Palette Cycling is simple rotating the color palette to fake the animation effect, it has very low CPU utilization even using software rendering, it makes a really good loading screen.  
I will be adding few more effects soon
* Breathing Effect (Soon)
